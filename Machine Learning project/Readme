In this project, I was required to create a machine learning algorithm to predict the amount of hydrogen produced from the electrolysis of water using
the electricity produced by the solar panel, but there was no dataset dedicated to that. I decided to use a dataset to predict the amount of electricity
produced by the solar panels, and through that After that, I use Avogadro's laws to determine the amount of hydrogen produced
